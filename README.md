- `day1_lab_linear_regression_advanced.py` - Advanced regression techniques, including Ridge, LASSO, SVM, and Decision Trees.
- `day1_r_squared.py` - Understanding R-squared and adjusted R-squared metrics.

### **Day 2: Classification**
- `day2_logistic_regression_basics.py` - Logistic regression fundamentals for binary classification.
- `day2_lab_classification_advanced.py` - Advanced classification models such as SVM, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.

### **Day 3: Neural Networks**
- `day3_nn_numpy_mnist.py` - Implementing a neural network from scratch using NumPy for MNIST classification.

### **Day 4: Deep Learning & Compression**
- `day4_dct_compression_numpy.py` - Implementing image compression using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with NumPy.
